I created this project to explore Twitter API. The script records tweets containing certain pre-selected words and exports the tweets into an excel file. Attributed collected include:
- User Name
- Data of post
- Tweet
- Coordinates of tweet

This file is linked to a config file (not unloaded) that contains my private twitter access token. 

I went on to clean the data in excel, and used ArcGIS to create the following maps:

The first describes the geographic spread of tweets (150 data points) soon after (45 minutes) Pete Buttigieg, a candidate in the Democratic Primary, dropped out of the race. Tweets primarily originated from the US, Canada, and the UK. From the map, it can be seen that the highest number of tweets originated from California (14), Texas (11) and New York (10).

The second describes the spread of the trending hashtag #DropOutBernie and #DropOutWarren amongst USA states (150 data points) when Pete dropped out of the race. From this map, we can see that the highest number of tweets originated from California (14), New York (12), and Utah (12).
